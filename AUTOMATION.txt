This suite can be run from the command line, via the 'emrun' browser automation.
To run the suite and capture results to a file, type

    python run.py [--browser=/path/to/firefox] > results_file.txt 2>&1

For more command line options that can be passed to run.py, type

    python emrun.py --help

Notes:

  - When running with Firefox, a clean temporary Firefox profile is used (hack emrun.py or run.py if this is not desirable)
  - results_file.txt receives a full test results after each test is run, so only the "last" matrix is the file is generally interesting.
  - If you run into any issues, email jjylanki@mozilla.com.
